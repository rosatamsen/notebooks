Resources
---------
- [e-book](http://www.ulaff.net/LAFF-N2LW-Spring14.html) - The primary resource in PDF format.
- [mooc](https://www.edx.org/course/laff-linear-algebra-foundations-to-frontiers) - Self-paced online course hosted on the edX platform.
- [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/LAFFutX/playlists) - 270+ short videos hosted on YouTube.
- [notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ULAFF/notebooks/tree/master) - Programming assignments with their corresponding answer-keys. They are organized week-by-week in this repository and can be previewed using Jupyter's online Notebook viewer.
- [python library](https://github.com/ULAFF/lib) - A small software library of vector and matrix operations.
- [app](http://ulaff.github.io/pages/download-software.html) - Self-contained software platform that allows interacting with the notebooks documents via a web browser. The Notebooks contain both executable python code and rich text elements.

Features
--------
- The software application has been preconfigured to work out of the box on all major operating systems.

- The app was configured using miniconda and includes everything needed for the programming exercises. There's no need to install anything else Simply download, extract, and run.

- The interactive programming Notebooks facilitate your learning as you connect the programming of vector and matrix operations to the mathematics of linear algebra.

Installation
------------
[Follow these download and setup instructions](http://ulaff.github.io/pages/download-software.html).

Contribute
----------
- Contribute code: Fix a bug, create a visualization tool, or add a new operation to the library.

- Contribute non-code: Report an issue, translate the notebooks into your language, write a blog post about your learning experience, or give us feedback.

- Let others know you are using these resources to learn linear algebra.

Support
