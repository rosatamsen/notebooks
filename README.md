Features
--------

- This repository contains the programming assignments which can be previewed using Jupyter's online Notebook viewer **[->
here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ULAFF/notebooks/tree/master)**.

- The interactive programming Notebooks facilitate your learning as you connect the programming of vector and matrix operations to the mathematics of linear algebra.

- The software application is a self-contained platform that allowa you to interact with and execute the code in the Notebooks. The app has been preconfigured to work out of the box on all major operating systems.

Installation
------------
[Follow these download and setup instructions](http://ulaff.github.io/pages/download-software.html).

Contribute
----------
- Contribute code: Fix a bug, create a visualization tool, or add a new operation to the library.

- Contribute non-code: Report an issue, translate the notebooks into your language, write a blog post about your learning experience, or give us feedback.

- Let others know you are using these resources to learn linear algebra.

Support
